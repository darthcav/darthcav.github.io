I decided over the weekend to start with some kind of blogging experience using GitHub pages. Within this post, I will describe briefly the configurations basics of my personal website in GitHub and a couple of hurdles I found on my way. As a main disclaimer, I am not a Ruby developer, so I had to experiment as I went along.
