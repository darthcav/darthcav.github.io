Sometimes you buy (or the IT guys of your company give you) a new computer with a pre-installed Windows. You happen to have an account with administrator rights, but the login screen does not display the damned **Administrator** account.

To solve that, simply open a **Console Prompt** and type:

~~~bat
net users Administrator /active:yes
~~~

<span lang="fr">Et voil√†!</span> your Administrator account is there.
